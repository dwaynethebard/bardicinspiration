# Welcome to Bardic Inspiration

This is a store that sells alchemy and magical ingredients. The goal of this
site is to create a repository of ingredients. A simple place to use for reference when
running a table top game/ writing a story and you need some magical ingredients.
made to look like a store, for fun. In the end items will have a picture, a description,
what game/story it's from and how it was used.
